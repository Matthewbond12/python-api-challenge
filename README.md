Python API Challenge - Bootcamp Module #6

Introduction:

In this challenge, we were tasked with importing APIs, specifically the OpenWeather API, to perform and graph some regression analysis. 

WeatherPy:

A lot of started code was given, so the first task we were given was to create the endpoint URL. This entailed reviewing the API documentation to determine how to best format the url. Next we had to identify the appropriate dictionary and begin appending the appropriate data to empty lsits using a for loop. Then we created a DataFrame with the relevant data that we wanted to use to determine a relationship with latitude: temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed. We then created an outpoint folder and saved data to csv file and saved graph images to the same folder. Next we used teachings from Matplotlib to graph the relationships between latitude and every other variable. Finally, we determined and charted the linear regression for each relationship.

VacationPy:
